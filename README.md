![Platform Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=AI+Policy+Execution+Platform)

## 🌟 Overview

The **AI Policy Execution Platform** is a cutting-edge solution designed to automate, analyze, and visualize complex policy documents. Leveraging advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **3D Data Visualization**, it transforms static PDF policies into actionable, real-time workflows.

Built for the **[Hackathon Name]**, this platform bridges the gap between bureaucratic documentation and digital execution.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Analysis
- **Automated Rule Extraction**: Instantly converts PDF policy documents into structured rules.
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies vague clauses and suggests clarifications using LLMs.
- **Neural Network Visualization**: Visualizes the AI's decision-making process in real-time.

### 📊 Mission Control Dashboard
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live tracking of task execution, escalations, and system health.
- **Role-Based Task Management**: Auto-assigns tasks to 'Admin', 'Officer', or 'Clerk' based on policy rules.
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs of every action for compliance and transparency.

### 🎨 Immersive Experience
- **3D Data Visualization**: "Victory Chamber" results page with interactive 3D elements.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, sleek interface with dynamic animations and glow effects.
- **Interactive Timelines**: Visual history of document processing and user activities.

### 📄 Smart Export
- **PDF Generation**: One-click export of processed policies with resolved ambiguities.
- **Structured Data**: Export results as JSON for integration with other systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (Animations)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), MongoDB (for Task Management)
- **AI/NLP**: Custom NLP Pipeline (hosted separately)
